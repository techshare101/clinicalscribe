ðŸŽ‰ UNLOCK YOUR BEAUTIFUL DASHBOARD! ðŸŽ‰

You're seeing the paywall because your user doesn't have beta access enabled.

Here's how to unlock the spectacular new dashboard:

## METHOD 1: Firebase Console (Easiest)

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/clinicalscribe-511e7/firestore
2. Navigate to Firestore Database > Data
3. Find the "profiles" collection
4. Look for your user document (probably your UID)
5. Edit the document and add/update these fields:
   ```
   betaActive: true
   ```
6. Save the changes
7. Refresh your dashboard page

## METHOD 2: Use the app's admin features

If you have admin access:
1. Go to /admin page in your app
2. Use the user management tools to enable beta access

## METHOD 3: Create test user with beta access

Sign up a new user and manually set their betaActive to true in Firestore.

## Your Email (for reference): valentin2v2000@gmail.com

Once you enable betaActive: true, you'll see:
âœ¨ Stunning glass morphism dashboard
âœ¨ Beautiful gradient stat cards  
âœ¨ Smooth framer-motion animations
âœ¨ Real-time data from Firestore
âœ¨ Spectacular visual effects

The new dashboard is already implemented and working - it's just hidden behind the paywall!
