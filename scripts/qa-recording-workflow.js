// QA Test Script for Multi-Session Recording + Auto-Combine Functionality
// This script helps test the entire workflow from:
// 1. Creating multiple recordings
// 2. Viewing them in the session detail page
// 3. Verifying auto-combine happens at 120 minutes
// 4. Testing audio playback with signed URLs

# Multi-Session Recording QA Test Plan

## Prerequisites
- Local ClinicalScribe instance running
- Valid Firebase Auth login
- Beta features enabled in your profile

## Test Flow

### Basic Recording Test
1. Create a new recording (Dashboard > Record)
2. Speak for ~30 seconds
3. Stop recording
4. Verify transcript appears
5. Click Play button on Dashboard to view session detail

### Session Detail Page
1. Verify session information appears
2. Verify recording appears in the RecordingsList
3. Verify audio playback works (audio player appears and plays)
4. Verify transcript text appears correctly

### Multiple Recordings Test
1. Return to transcription page
2. Create another recording in the same session
3. Verify both recordings appear in the session detail page
4. Test Combine button (should merge recordings and produce a SOAP note)
5. Verify all audio recordings still play correctly after combining

### Auto-Combine Threshold Test
1. Use the Firebase Console to:
   - Find your session document in 'patientSessions' collection
   - Manually set totalDuration to 7199 (just under threshold)
   - Add one more small recording (should trigger auto-combine)
2. Verify auto-combine was triggered (see console logs)
3. Verify final SOAP appears in the session detail page
4. Verify the auto-combine banner appears at the top of the page
5. Check the dashboard for the "Auto-Combined" tag on the session

### PDF Export Test After Merge
1. With a combined SOAP note visible, look for the PDF export option
2. Generate PDF from the combined SOAP note
3. Verify PDF contains all content from multiple recording segments
4. Test downloading and opening the PDF
5. Verify all formatting and content is correct in the PDF
