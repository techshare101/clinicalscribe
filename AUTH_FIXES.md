# Authentication and Authorization Fixes

This document explains the changes made to fix the authentication and authorization issues in the ClinicalScribe application.

## Problem Summary

The application had several authentication-related issues:

1. **caresim user**: Could see dashboard tabs but was redirected to login when clicking the Transcription tab
2. **valentin2v2000 user**: Could see the Upgrade Beta paywall instead of normal dashboard tabs
3. **Inconsistent tab visibility**: Different users saw different sets of tabs based on unclear logic

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues were caused by fragmented authentication logic:

1. **Session verification**: The application verified session cookies but didn't properly check user roles
2. **Subscription checks**: Some pages checked for subscriptions while others only checked for authentication
3. **Tab visibility logic**: The Navigation component had inconsistent logic for showing/hiding tabs
4. **Role-based access**: Admin users weren't properly identified and given access to all features

## Solution Overview

We implemented a unified authentication and authorization system with the following components:

### 1. Unified Authentication Helper (`lib/requireUser.ts`)

Created a centralized authentication helper that:
- Verifies session cookies using Firebase Admin SDK
- Checks user roles and subscription status
- Provides consistent authentication logic across the application
- Handles both authentication-only and subscription-required scenarios

### 2. Server-Side Authentication Wrappers

Created server-side wrappers for protected pages:
- `/app/dashboard/page-server.tsx` - For dashboard (authentication required)
- `/app/transcription/page-server.tsx` - For transcription (subscription required)
- `/app/soap/page-server.tsx` - For SOAP pages (subscription required)

### 3. Updated Navigation Logic

Modified the Navigation component to:
- Show all tabs to admin users regardless of subscription status
- Show all tabs to users with active beta access
- Show only pricing/plans tabs to non-subscribed users
- Properly handle tab click events with role-based access control

## Implementation Details

### New Authentication Functions

```typescript
// Check if user is authenticated (no subscription required)
async function requireAuth()

// Check if user is authenticated AND has active subscription
async function requireSubscription()
```

### Page Protection Pattern

Each protected page now follows this pattern:

1. Server-side wrapper checks authentication/subscription
2. If user doesn't meet requirements, redirect to appropriate page
3. If user meets requirements, render the client component

### Tab Visibility Logic

The Navigation component now uses this logic:
- Admin users see all tabs
- Beta users see all tabs
- Non-subscribed users see only pricing/plans tabs

## Testing the Solution

To test the fixes:

1. **Admin users** (like caresim):
   - Should see all dashboard tabs
   - Should be able to access all pages without redirects
   - Should see "Admin Mode" indicator

2. **Subscribed users** (with betaActive=true):
   - Should see all dashboard tabs
   - Should be able to access all pages

3. **Non-subscribed users**:
   - Should only see Pricing/Plans tabs
   - Should be redirected to pricing page when trying to access protected pages

## Files Modified

- `lib/requireUser.ts` - New authentication helper
- `components/Navigation.tsx` - Updated tab visibility logic
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Server wrapper for dashboard
- `app/dashboard/page-client.tsx` - Renamed original dashboard component
- `app/dashboard/page-server.tsx` - Server-side authentication wrapper
- `app/transcription/page.tsx` - Server wrapper for transcription
- `app/transcription/page-client.tsx` - Renamed original transcription component
- `app/transcription/page-server.tsx` - Server-side authentication wrapper
- `app/soap/page.tsx` - Server wrapper for SOAP
- `app/soap/page-client.tsx` - Renamed original SOAP component
- `app/soap/page-server.tsx` - Server-side authentication wrapper

## Verification Steps

1. Test with admin user (caresim):
   - Login and verify all tabs are visible
   - Navigate to transcription page and verify access is granted
   - Check that "Admin Mode" indicator is visible

2. Test with subscribed user:
   - Login and verify all tabs are visible
   - Navigate to transcription page and verify access is granted

3. Test with non-subscribed user:
   - Login and verify only pricing/plans tabs are visible
   - Try to access transcription page and verify redirect to pricing
