# Suspense Boundary Fix Summary

## Problem
The Next.js 15 build was failing with the error:
```
useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/auth/login"
```

This error occurred because `useSearchParams()` was being called during static generation, which requires proper Suspense boundaries.

## Solution
We implemented two approaches to fix this issue:

### 1. For the Login Page (`/auth/login`)
- Used dynamic imports with `ssr: false` to ensure the client component is only rendered on the client side
- Wrapped the component in a Suspense boundary with a loading fallback

### 2. For All Other Components Using `useSearchParams()`
- Completely removed all instances of `useSearchParams()` 
- Replaced with client-side `URLSearchParams` 
- Used `useEffect` with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks to ensure parameters are only accessed on the client side

## Files Modified

1. `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Implemented dynamic import with Suspense boundary
2. `app/auth/login/page-client.tsx` - Removed useSearchParams and replaced with URLSearchParams
3. `components/HomePageClientInner.tsx` - Replaced useSearchParams with URLSearchParams
4. `components/LandingPageClientInner.tsx` - Replaced useSearchParams with URLSearchParams
5. `components/LandingPageContentInner.tsx` - Replaced useSearchParams with URLSearchParams
6. `components/SettingsPageInner.tsx` - Replaced useSearchParams with URLSearchParams
7. `components/SuccessPageInner.tsx` - Replaced useSearchParams with URLSearchParams

## Why This Fixes the Issue
In Next.js 15, `useSearchParams()` can cause issues during static generation because it relies on context that may not be available at build time. By using client-side only approaches:

1. We ensure that search parameters are only accessed when the component is actually running in the browser
2. We avoid any server-side rendering issues that could cause the build to fail
3. We maintain the same functionality while making the code compatible with static generation

These changes should resolve the build error and allow the application to deploy successfully to Vercel.

## Verification
All instances of `useSearchParams()` have been removed from the codebase. The application should now build successfully without Suspense boundary errors.
